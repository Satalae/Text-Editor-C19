# PWA Text Editor  

## Description  
A Text Editor application that allows you to save snippets of code!

## How to use  
This Text editor is quite simple, you only need to type whatever code you need into the command line, and whenever you click out of the window or on the blue header on top of the window, it will save whatever you have written to localstorage and to it's own personal database using IndexedDB! Through this database, it can even work when not connected to the internet when installed as an app!  
When you click the install button, you will be prompted to install the program, which will put it on your computer to be used either quickly, or offline!
